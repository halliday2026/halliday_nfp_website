              Why Halliday exists
            </h2>
            <div class="space-y-4 text-[var(--color-text-muted)] leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                Halliday was founded to bridge a gap that we kept running into: nonprofit evaluation teams doing genuinely important work, with rigorous methodologies and deep expertise in their fields — constrained by tools and processes that couldn't keep up with what they needed to know.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem wasn't a lack of good technology. It was that most technology is designed for different problems. Generic software platforms aren't built around logic models, funder reporting cycles, or mixed-methods evaluation frameworks. And the consultants who understood evaluation often didn't have the technical depth to translate that understanding into working systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                That's the gap we fill.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2
              class="text-2xl font-bold text-[var(--color-text)] mb-4"
              style="font-family: var(--font-heading);"

              We did the work to understand your work
            </h2>
            <div class="space-y-4 text-[var(--color-text-muted)] leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                We took the time to deeply understand the evaluation workflow — logic models, theories of change, mixed methods, funder reporting requirements — because you can't build good tools without understanding the work they're meant to support.
              </p>
              <p>
                We know what it means when an evaluation team says their data collection is "fragmented." We know what a quarterly funder report actually involves. We understand the difference between output tracking and outcome measurement, and why that distinction matters for what you build.
              </p>
              <p>
                That domain knowledge is what makes our technical work useful rather than just functional.

              Built for how nonprofits actually operate
            </h2>
            <div class="space-y-4 text-[var(--color-text-muted)] leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                We know nonprofits operate with small teams, tight budgets, and high accountability standards. Our solutions are designed for that reality — not for some idealized enterprise scenario where there's an IT department to call and a six-figure software budget to work with.
              </p>
              <p>
                That means we build for maintainability. The systems we create are ones your team can actually use and manage without a dedicated technical staff member. We don't build dependencies; we build capacity.
