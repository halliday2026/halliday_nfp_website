Nonprofit evaluation teams spend an extraordinary amount of time on reporting. This guide explores how AI tools can help — and where human judgment still matters most.

## The Reporting Bottleneck

Most evaluation teams report the same frustration: the analysis is done, the data tells a clear story, but turning that into a polished funder report takes weeks of writing, editing, and formatting.

AI-assisted writing tools can dramatically compress this timeline when used strategically.

## Where AI Helps Most

- **Narrative first drafts**: AI can generate a structured narrative from your data summary, which your team then edits and refines
- **Template population**: Automated tools can pull data points directly into report templates, eliminating manual copy-paste
- **Consistency checking**: AI can flag inconsistencies between your data tables and narrative descriptions

## Where Human Judgment Is Essential

- Interpreting unexpected findings
- Contextualizing outcomes for specific funder relationships
- Ensuring qualitative stories are told with appropriate sensitivity

## Getting Started

The best place to begin is with your most repetitive reporting tasks — quarterly progress reports that follow a consistent structure are ideal candidates for partial automation.
