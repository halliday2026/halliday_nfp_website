Every evaluation team reaches a point where the tools that got them started start holding them back. Here are five signs you've crossed that threshold.

## Sign 1: Your Data Lives in Multiple Places and No One Knows Which Is Current

If your team regularly debates which Excel file is the "real" one, you have a data management problem that no amount of discipline will solve. The answer is a single source of truth.

## Sign 2: Report Preparation Consumes More Than 20% of Staff Time

Track it for one reporting cycle. If report writing and data compilation are consuming a fifth or more of your team's capacity, that's a signal that technology can meaningfully help.

## Sign 3: You Can't Answer Basic Program Questions Without a Major Data Pull

"How many participants completed the full program this quarter?" should take seconds, not hours. If it requires someone to compile a spreadsheet, your analytics infrastructure needs attention.

## Sign 4: Data Errors Are Discovered After Reports Are Submitted

Manual data entry and cleaning processes inevitably produce errors. When those errors surface after reports go to funders, the stakes become very high. Automated validation catches problems at the source.

## Sign 5: New Staff Take Months to Understand Your Data Systems

If your data processes are so complex that institutional knowledge is a prerequisite for using them, that's a fragility risk — and a sign that the systems need to be redesigned for clarity.

## What to Do Next

If you recognized two or more of these signs, a technology assessment is worth your time. [Book a free workflow review](/contact) to talk through where your process has the most room for improvement.
